Welcome to LimpLisp :v
======================

What dis?
---------
This is the repository I use for my programming class assignments. It's more of a garbage patch than an organized effort, as most things aren't really sorted in any way. Well, at least that's the case for the actually coded stuff.

What's in it for me?
--------------------
Nothing. I mean, you can try, but...

Ok but why is it called LimpLisp?
---------------------------------
The repo started out with linked lists and I didn't have an idea for a good name, so I just took "linked list(s)" and butchered it (kind of).

Unnecessary footer
